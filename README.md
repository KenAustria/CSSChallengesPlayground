# React Challenges Playground

A library of CSS challenges.

## How To Use

Each React component focuses on one relative CSS challenge, which is described as the file's name.

Rename the file to `index.js` and move the file to the same level as `index.css`.

Then run `npm start` to run in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
